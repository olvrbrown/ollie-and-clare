Ollie and Clare love good design, whether this is a poster, a wedding invite or a piece of furniture. We believe that good design makes everything better, and love creating things that look beautiful.

We thoroughly enjoyed creating a brand for our wedding and seeing this play out across invites, order of service and table decorations. Clare is heavily involved in graphic design at work and loves creating booklets for churches to explain their design projects. Ollie and Clare recently designed their own Christmas cards, which they are hoping to sell for Christmas 2016.
