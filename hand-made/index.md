Both Ollie and Clare like getting away from computer screens and making things with their hands, whether this be wood, glue, paper, material or wool. Ollie recently bought some exciting tools and is designing and making an iPad stand, while Clare likes making cards, crochet and sewing. They especially like making things as gifts for friends and family.
