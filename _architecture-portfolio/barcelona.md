The highlights of the trip included a visit to Parc Guell and other buildings designed by Antoni Gaudi, strolling along the seafront, and seeing the Barcelona Pavilion (Ludwig Mies van der Rohe). The first design studio project Clare undertook was to build a model of this, so seeing it in the flesh was very interesting.
