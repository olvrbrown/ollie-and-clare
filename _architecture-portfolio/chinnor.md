The project at Chinnor Methodist Church has been moving since 2006. JBKS Architects were appointed in 2012, and Clare started work on it as an assistant to the director. She was responsible for the day-to-day running of the project; arranging meetings, drawing the developing design and creating presentation material.

As the project progressed, Clare was given more responsibility and was in put charge of the planning application and technical design. She enjoyed managing colleagues to make sure the work was done at the correct time. The planning application was approved with no conditions, which Clare and the clients were very pleased about. 

The tenders were sent out in February 2016 and the project is now undergoing cost cutting to allow construction to start. From this Clare has learnt that it is imperative to always have a good grasp of the costs throughout the life of a project, and that it is well worth pausing before tender for a pre-tender cost plan. She has enjoyed working closely with the clients, contractors and colleagues to reduce the scope of the project and has found that this has greatly improved her understanding of building costs. 


### Key Tasks:

- Running the project under a director for Stages 1 – 3
- Developing the feasibility design and producing promotional material for consultation
- Assisting with the design development stages 2 – 3

- Project Architect for Stage 4
