Clare was involved in preparing the Design & Access Statement for this project in 2011. She was in charge of writing the text and creating and collating images to accompany the submission. This was one of the first design and access statements Clare wrote, so was pleased when the scheme was granted permission. 

The photos below show the finished building, with the new entrance lobby, reordered church interior, and two-storey extension at the rear of the site.
