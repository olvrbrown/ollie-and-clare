JBKS Architects were invited to participate in a design competition for a new building at the heart of Downe House School. This prestigious girls’ school needed a new conference hall that could also act as a hub for the whole site; somewhere for the students to gather, meet and chat, as well as learn.

Clare was responsible for designing and collating the submission material for JBKS Architect’s entry. She oversaw a team of people to develop a beautiful brochure that showcased the proposed design. Although JBKS Architects were not successful, the interview panel commented on the time and effort that had gone into the submission document; stating that it was the best they had received. 

Although the firm was not successful, Clare was very proud of the end result, and has been able to use images from this in many other submission documents to illustrate the kind of work the company can produce. Clare was very organised in how the work for the submission was carried out, making sure everyone working on it knew what they were doing and the purpose of their work. This meant the document was finished in good time, and looked stunning. 

JBKS Architects were asked to produce a shorted summary document of our submission, which Clare put together using images and text from the original document. These are both shown in the images below. 

Clare thoroughly enjoyed managing a team of people to do a specific task, and felt that although JBKS Architects did not win the job, she had succeeded in producing an excellent piece of work. The management experience was very helpful, and helped Clare to be more confident in taking on extra responsibility. 


### Key Tasks:

- Leading a team of architects and architectural assistants in producing the competition submission, including:
- Coordinating images and text from both inside and outside the office
- Teaching colleagues how to draw up and colour a site plan
- Sourcing images for a mood-board
- Using Adobe InDesign to create the final submission booklet
- Summarising the full submission into a shorter document for the interview
- Allocating work to colleagues based on experience and skills
- Answering questions and meeting deadlines
