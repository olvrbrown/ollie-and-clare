As part of a studio project to design a healthy office, Clare was asked to monitor how she worked over a twelve hour period, then to change one key thing and monitor how this affected her productivity. As this project took place during the third year of the undergraduate degree, Clare was writing her dissertation at the same time. She therefore monitored two days or research and writing, one at home and one in the university library.

The output of the log was left to the students to decide. Clare had the idea of making models of the different desks she worked at and creating a different model for each time something changed in her log of the days. While this was a lot of work, it clearly showed the structure of each day and how easily distracted Clare was at home. This helped her with the design of the workspaces in the final office.

The photos below show the models she created on display in the studios. Clare thoroughly enjoys making models, and loves miniature things, so this project was a lot of fun.
