St Mildred's Church want to demolish their existing church hall, which is in very poor repair and close to being condemned, and build a new church hall which has much better links to the main church. This will wrap around the apse of the church and create a new entrance, alongside offices, meeting rooms, and a wonderful central concourse. The two-storey hall will be positioned over the footprint of the existing hall, and will include meeting rooms at first floor level.

Clare has recently taken over the project architect role at St Mildred's from a colleague on maternity leave. The project was inbetween Stage 1 and 2, so Clare's main role has been agreeing the appointment document for Stage 2 - 6 and developing the project management to move the scheme forward. This has included agreeing fees, a timeline up to planning, and the terms and conditions of the appointment. 

Taking over an existing project from a colleague has had its challenges, but Clare has enjoyed grappling with these and striving to make sure that the client remains happy. She enjoys and is good at the project management side of architecture, especially setting project up well so that if anything does happen in later stages there is a firm footing for both client and architect. 


### Key Tasks:

- Assisting a colleague with early design work, including the design for the feasibility study summary document
- Taking over the project architect role from a colleague on maternity leave
- Developing the Stage 2 - 6 appointment document
- Project management
