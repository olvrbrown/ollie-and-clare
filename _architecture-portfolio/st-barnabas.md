This project is being financed by the London Diocese, who have sold the church of St Barnabas to developers and have bought a large office block for the church to meet in. The project consists of refurbishing and extending the offices to make them suitable for a church.

JBKS won the project through a competition in 2013. Clare helped in the development of the competition design, and in drawing up the presentation material for the interview.

Clare has been involved in this project on an ad-hoc basis, assisting colleagues and director when needed for presentations, meetings and deadlines. Her major involvement was in summer 2014 when the project architect was away and some work needed to be completed urgently. Clare was asked to step in and create a simple SketchUp model which could be used as the basis for a watercolour drawing. However, the model itself was preferred to the watercolour view, and ended up being used on a number of promotional items for the project. Clare was very pleased with this, as it was a small piece of work that captured the vision and feel of the design. 


### Key Tasks:

- Assisting colleagues when necessary for presentations, meetings etc.
- Creating a 3D view using SketchUp and Photoshop of the front of the proposed building
