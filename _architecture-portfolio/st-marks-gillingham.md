Clare assisted in winning this project while at a marketing event for JBKS Architects. She was responsible for running the stand, talking to people as they passed by, and answering questions about potential jobs. Once the event was over, Clare was responsible for following up the possible jobs and for taking them forward into live projects.

St Marks is a large church in the centre of a fairly deprived area of Gillingham. The project is small; the reconfiguring of an extension and chapel to provide toilets, a vestry and an office, but could well lead to a larger reordering in the future. The project is being managed by the clients so as to reduce travelling costs; with the church leading the consultation with the DAC and heritage bodies, and JBKS Architects producing the necessary drawings and reports. This is working well for both parties. 

Clare has recently been responsible for producing the Stage 2 (Concept Design) set of drawings. An initial meeting with the clients at the church produced some hand-drawn sketches of the proposed scheme, which Clare then drew up and detailed ready for initial consultations with the DAC. 


### Key Tasks:

- Winning the job
- Following up the potential project lead
- Visiting the church and agreeing the design proposals
- Drawing up the proposals and detailing them suitable for initial consultation with the DAC
- Agreeing the architectural fees and appointment for the project
