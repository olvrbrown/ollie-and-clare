Clare has been involved with this project on and off since it started in 2013. She was responsible for designing the summary brochure for the end of the feasibility study, leaflets for communication with local residents, and the development of the elevational design. 

Clare thoroughly enjoyed helping to draw up the elevations and plans of the building, and see how the designs for the appearance came together as a result of teamwork and good design. 

The project is now on pause for fundraising.



### Key Tasks:

- Designing  the feasibility study summary brochure
- Developing leaflets and boards for consultation with the congregation and local community
- Assisting with the design development of the elevations, and elevational concepts
