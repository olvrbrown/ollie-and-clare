Clare has been working on the project at ChristChurch Woking since the interview in July 2013. She was asked to assist the Director as the brief included developing a brand for the project; something that Clare’s skills in graphic design would lend themselves to. She has since taken on the role of Project Architect, running the job from the office under the direction of a director. Clare handles the day-to-day communication, attends and documents meetings, draws the design and in heavily involved in the management of the project to make sure it stays on programme.

Recently Clare has been involved in the design of the elevations, as well as working hard to agree terms and conditions for the architectural appointment. She found this very interesting, and was able to put into practice what she had learnt in her Part III. She is currently overseeing the appointment of other consultants. 

The redevelopment of this Grade II listed church is complicated by its position in the very centre of Woking. The brief asks for a building that matches its surroundings in terms of modernity and facilities, but also stands out clearly as a church. The scheme designed includes the remodelling of the current extension to provide more meeting space, redevelopment of the bookshop and café, a new-build crèche at the front of the site, and dedicated youth centre at the rear. The proposals include reordering the worship space, with new heating, supplementary lighting, updating finishes and overhauling the services for the whole building. The result will be a new, modern and light-filled building that will serve the church well. 

As the project is not yet in the public domain, no images of the proposals are able to be included on this website. If you’re interested in hearing more about the project, please do get in touch.
