Haslemere Methodist Church approached JBKS Architects to carry out a feasibility study in September 2013. A masterplan approach was taken to allow the clients to develop the existing buildings in a logical fashion, undertaking smaller projects but working towards a larger, planned whole.

Clare worked with a director during the preliminary design stage to develop the client's brief and provide designs that met this. The vision was for a building that was open to the local community; upgrading the caf√© at the front of the building and creating penetrability through to the sanctuary at the rear. The budget was tight, and costs were very important. 

Clare enjoyed taking a comprehensive view of both the site and the needs of the church on this project; creating a proposed scheme that solved the problems of the existing building but allowed for smaller projects to be undertaken on an ad-hoc basis. 

The client were happy with the outcome, and have started developing the building in line with the feasibility study outcomes. Clare was able to lead meetings on this project, which she thoroughly enjoyed and found to be a good experience.
