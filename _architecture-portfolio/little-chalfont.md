Clare was responsible for compiling the submission document to win the job, and assisted with the early design development and presentation material. As the project has moved towards planning permission, Clare has been involved in the creation of presentation material for community and church consultation events. Some of these are shown in the images below. 

Clare has enjoyed working on a community centre project, and has appreciated the differences between this and a new-build church project. She has enjoyed being involved with the preparations for wider consultation in the village, and in working out how to show a scheme so that people understand it quickly. 


### Key Tasks:

- Winning the job
