The starting project for Year 3 of Clare’s undergraduate degree was to design a shelter for an area in Bristol. Part of the project included using the derive technique to find the location of our shelter. Clare decided to build her shelter off a railway bridge in the St Werburghs area of Bristol. From the road the bridge looked like any other railway bridge, however the interior had been decorated in an explosion of colour, which was a very unexpected but exciting find.

The shelter was to be a structure that came off the railway bridge, which was located in-between a school and a housing estate. It would be used by families on their way to and from school, so it was important that the shelter should have an aspect of fun, providing an alternative route across the bridge. 

The images below document the process of the derive and the final choice of location, as well as the design of the shelter.
