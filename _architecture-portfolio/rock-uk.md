JBKS Architects were involved with projects on several of the sites owned and run by Rock UK, a Christian outdoor activities holiday company. The Summit Centre was a site purchased by Rock UK in Trelewis, South Wales. The purpose of the project was to refurbish the existing centre to create a building that was inviting and accessible to all and allowed the site to be given renewed purpose as a regional activity and outdoor pursuits centre.

Clare was involved in the development of the early design in her Part I placement year, under a project architect and a director. The first piece of work she ever undertook at JBKS Architects was on this project. A planning application was submitted for the project in June 2011, with a comprehensive Design & Access Statement written and compiled by Clare. 

Design & Access Statements are given much more emphasis in the Welsh planning system, so the document produced had to be high quality. Clare was asked to create a document that not only contained the necessary information, but that told the story of the centre and the proposed scheme. The design Clare developed was simple but left plenty of room for photos, images and diagrams to explain the scheme. 

Clare assisted in other areas of the project; creating presentation drawings and designing some boards to assist with the fundraising. She liaised with the planning officers to answer questions during the application process, and was able to use her knowledge from her degree to benefit the company and the client. 


### Key Tasks:

- Assisting with the early design development
- Creating presentation drawings and 3D models
- Writing, designing and collating the Design & Access Statement for the planning application
- Liaising with planning officers during the application process
- Assisting colleagues on the project when needed
