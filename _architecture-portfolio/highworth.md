This Grade I listed church project is situated in Highworth, Wiltshire. The church wants to increase flexibility through a reordering of the internal space. This will be supplemented by a small toilet and plant room extension, giving the church key facilities. Originally a larger, separate extension was proposed in the churchyard but this was met with opposition from the amenity societies so was scaled down.

Clare has been involved in this project on an ad-hoc basis, assisting the project architect where required. She was involved with the writing and design work for the Statements of Need and Significance, two documents required by the DAC for a Faculty Application. As this was considered to be a complex project, effort was put into designing the Statements to show, as well as tell, the needs of the church and how these needs were met in the proposed scheme.

Clare was also involved in writing the design and access statement for the planning application in 2014. This was the first design and access statement she had done on a Grade I listed building. The external changes were minimal, but needed explaining against the backdrop of the whole scheme. As St Michael's is a church, it is exempt from Listed Building Consent under the Ecclesiastical Exemption Act. This meant the planning application was for full planning permission only. 

### Key Tasks:

- Assisting with the writing and formatting of the Statements of Need and Significance
- Writing and formatting the Design & Access Statement
