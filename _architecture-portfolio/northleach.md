The Grade I listed church of St Peter & St Paul in Northleach is known as the 'Cathedral of the Cotswolds'. JBKS Architects were invited to compete for the reordering of the church in early 2015. The competition included the completion of a length pre-qualification questionnaire, which Clare was asked to oversee and compile. This followed on from the submission of an initial document outlining the ethos of the company, case studies, references and an idea of approach towards a project of this size.

Clare completed all aspects of the competition entry on time, and to a high standard. She was able to use templates created over the past three years to compile documents quickly, while making sure they were tailored to the project. 

Completing the pre-qualification questionnaire took some time, but the end result provided comprehensive answers to the questions. Clare developed a system of attachments to answer the more complex questions, allowing the form to be read simply as an introduction, with additional information for certain questions where this was considered necessary. The attachments were designed to be reused on other projects or competition entries so as to maximise efficiency, and since being created in 2015 they have been reused for a number of projects. 

Clare was able to combine her organisational skills in pulling the document together with her skills in writing, and in expressing the aims and ethos of the company in this competition entry. JBKS Architects were not successful in winning the job as they did not have experience of working within the boundaries of a Heritage Lottery funded project. Clare was pleased with the outcome of the submission document, and has been pleased that aspects of it have been able to be reused. 

The images below illustrate some of the work the office produced for the initial submission document and the pre-qualification questionnaire.


### Key Tasks:

- Compiling and submitting the initial information pack
- Leading the submission of the pre-qualification questionnaire, and collating all the parts into a single submission
- Developing a design for additional information sheets that could be reused in other projects (i.e. specific case studies, staff CV's and the office policy on inclusive design), then populating these with text and images.
