The masterplan for High Leigh Conference Centre in Hoddesden began as a potential refurbishment of two accommodation wings in late 2014. Designs were produced for this, and Clare led the interviewing of potential contractors to assess the possibility of finishing the scheme by the July deadline. It was decided that this would not be possible, and that a masterplan for the whole site should be undertaken to make sure any future development was carried out in line with a 20-year plan for the whole site. This would help to reduce ad-hoc development.

Clare took on the role of Project Architect for the initial accommodation refurbishment, and for the masterplan. She worked under a director to develop the designs in close consultation with a client group, consisting of trustees, the CEO and associate CEO of Christian Conference Trust, the site manager, and the person responsible for the in-house construction team. This intense briefing period allowed the designs for the masterplan to progress quickly, with a final scheme presented to the full board of Trustees in July 2015.

Clare’s role was to manage the project, attending and documenting meetings and developing the drawings to ensure the project kept on track. She used AutoCAD, Photoshop and InDesign to develop the architectural design and the presentations. She was able to further her design skills in the plan development of different parts of the masterplan; grappling with problems such as tying into existing floor levels, a large sloping site, providing disabled access to all parts of the building, and developing a masterplan that could be undertake in sensible-sized chunks. 

Clare has thoroughly enjoyed working on this project; especially the challenge of working at a larger scale. She was able to use techniques learnt in her Urban Design specialisation to develop a masterplan that fulfils the client’s brief and provides a clear, comprehensive development strategy for the next 20+ years. She especially enjoyed working with the project team to develop a clear brief, as this smoothed the way for the remainder of the project.  

The first phase of the masterplan is currently in Stage 3 (Developed Design). This is the [extension and refurbishment of the Chapel](/architecture/portfolio/cct-chapel/).
