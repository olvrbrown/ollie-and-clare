Clare has been Project Architect for the Chapel redevelopment project since it began in September 2015. This project is moving significantly quicker than a church project tends to, which Clare is enjoying. She has appreciated working with a good client and project team to develop the design; using meetings, presentations and design team sessions to push the design forward towards a planning application.

Clare took on the role of Project Architect for the initial accommodation refurbishment, and for the masterplan. She worked under a director to develop the designs in close consultation with a client group, consisting of trustees, the CEO and associate CEO of Christian Conference Trust, the site manager, and the person responsible for the in-house construction team. This intense briefing period allowed the designs for the masterplan to progress quickly, with a final scheme presented to the full board of Trustees in July 2015.

The project is the redevelopment and extension of the existing Chapel on the High Leigh Conference Centre site. The Chapel will be extended to create a new, modern conference space to seat up to 200 people with ancillary accommodation. The project also comprises a new landscaped courtyard in the place of an existing car park to the south of the Chapel. A key aim of the project is to redesign the entrance sequence to the conference centre, creating a space outside the main reception that is beautiful and welcoming. Construction is due to start in January 2017, with a view to completion in late June.

Clare has enjoyed being the day-to-day contact for the project and is confident in answering queries, arranging meetings and giving presentations to the Board of Trustees. The clients are very happy with Clare’s involvement in the project, and her organisational skills and high standards of work have meant that it has progressed smoothly so far. She has thoroughly enjoyed working with the Project Manager to make sure all deadlines are met, and that all stakeholders are kept informed and happy.

Clare has recently overseen the submission of the planning application for this project. As it is a fairly small project she was able to write the design and access statement herself; something she likes doing. She recently presented the planning application scheme to the Board of Trustees with minimal help from a Director, which was a good experience and she enjoyed very much. 


### Key Tasks:

- Creating a framework agreement for the whole masterplan and bolt-in project-specific agreements for each phase. Using the RIBA terms and conditions as a base and working with the client to develop our own appointment document

- Working with the client team to progress the brief
- Assisting a Director to design the extension and landscaping proposals, and drawing these up
- Creating presentation drawings and images

- Attending and documenting project board and design team meetings
