Clare visited Berlin in November 2008 as part of the undergraduate course. Having never been to Germany before she was unsure what to expect, but thoroughly enjoyed visiting the city and would love to go again.

A key highlight of the trip was a visit to the Jewish Museum designed by Daniel Liebeskind - one of Clareâ€™s favourite architects. Other highlights included seeing a large-scale model of the city, visiting the Nordic Embassies buildings, visiting the Reichstag Dome by Norman Foster, and hiring bicycles for a day to nip around the city. 

Clare hopes to go back to the city and take Ollie with her in the near future.
