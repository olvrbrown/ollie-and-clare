This new village-centre church building replaces the existing church, a low and dark building. The proposed scheme is a two-storey modern space with plenty of glass and foyer space to encourage impromptu conversations. The building has a nursery to house the current nursery meeting at the rear of the site.

Clare has been involved in the project as needed throughout her time at JBKS Architects, although has never been directly responsible for the job. She has been instrumental in creating presentation images of the proposed scheme, whether these were plans, sections or 3D elevational views. 

Clare wrote and illustrated the design and access statement for the 2014 planning application. As this was a large scheme for its location in the centre of the village, it was likely to be contentious. Clare had to make sure the design and access statement covered as many issues as possible so that these were answered ahead of the application process.

The project budget was cut after planning permission was granted, meaning the design has had to be drastically changed. The images below illustrate the first scheme, that was granted planning permission in July 2014. The scheme now has two floors instead of three, and has been redesigned to use space more efficiently. Clare helped to redesign the plans alongside a director, which she thoroughly enjoyed. 


### Key Tasks:

- Creating presentation images for meetings and consultations
- Assisting colleagues and directors where necessary
- Writing and illustrating design and access statement
- Assisting with the redesign of the scheme to reduce the cost
