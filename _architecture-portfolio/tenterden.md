St Mildred’s is a Grade I listed church in the centre of the historic town of Tenterden. The reordering proposes new heating, lighting, finishes, seating and gallery to meet the needs of the current, growing church. The feasibility study has been long, starting in 2014 and due to complete in May 2016, with a presentation to the church congregation.

The Grade I listed status of the church has meant that plans needs to be carefully linked to the need of the church family and the significance of the building and churchyard. Negotiations and consultations with statutory and heritage authorities have been crucial to the development of the proposals, and careful consultation with St Mildred’s Parochial Church Council (PCC) in early 2016 have paved the way to the final consultation with the church. 

Clare has been working on the project since it began in 2014 and has enjoyed getting to know the client team and the building. She has been able to lead the feasibility study, assisting a director in preparing for meetings, leading presentations and designing the design summary booklet for the end of the preliminary design stage. Clare has been key in bridging the gap between two directors working on the project; her organisation and ability to recall meetings and conversations has meant that the project has kept moving forward. 

Clare enjoys working with historic and listed buildings, and has enjoyed the consultation that comes with this type of project. She enjoys the challenge of finding a design that meets the need of the church but also respects the history and significance of the building. 


### Key Tasks:

- Running the feasibility study alongside a director

- Presenting the scheme to the Parochial Church Council (PCC) and answering questions that arose from this
- Keeping the project moving and contacting the clients regularly
- Assisting the client in consultation with the Diocesan Advisory Committee and the Heritage Bodies.
