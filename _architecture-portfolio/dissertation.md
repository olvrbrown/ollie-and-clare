The title of Clare’s dissertation was **what are the aesthetic characteristics of seaside pleasure architecture in the UK?** This was explored through a comparative case study of Blackpool and Brighton.
{: .lead}

The purpose of the dissertation was to explore the idea of the seaside resort within an architectural agenda to find out what the aesthetic characteristics of seaside pleasure architecture are, concentrating specifically on the visual aspects of aesthetics. Brighton and Blackpool were chosen as case studies to help reach this purpose, and have led to much of the answers and information
within the essay.

The method used to answer the question involved research from secondary sources that led to a ‘checklist’ of general characteristics for seaside pleasure architecture. This was used within the comparative case study framework along with photos, analytical sketches and philosophical theory to evaluate whether the structures looked at fitted in with the norm, and if not how they differed. The dissertation question could then be answered in light of both the original research and the first-hand evidence from the case studies.

The seaside is a place that has been greatly developed in a relatively short period of time and therefore the aesthetic characteristics of the pleasure architecture there differs greatly. Clare’s dissertation found that it is not the built environment that makes the place what it is, but the atmosphere created by the people themselves.
