Shortly after the Downe House School competition, JBKS Architects were invited to compete for a job at Gold Hill Baptist Church. The church were considering purchasing a piece of land and developing a brand new community hub. This would house church services on a Sunday, but would be open to the community for the rest of the week as a conference venue, café, courses, children’s and youth clubs, and concerts. A playing field to the rear adds to the flexibility of the site. The existing church building would be sold off as housing to help fund the new community development.

Because of her success in running the Downe House School competition entry, Clare was asked to run this submission as well. By this point she already had extensive experience in putting submission documents together and winning jobs, which helped her with these more prestigious projects. 

A team of people was assembled to write the information required and to develop the images and designs necessary for the submission. Clare acted in a managing role, allocating jobs to those best equipped to carry them out, answering questions and collating all the information in InDesign as it was completed. 

Clare designed a printed document that summarised the designs for both community hub and church site, as well as including an accommodation schedule and a fee proposal. This was to be supported by an interview presentation, which Clare also designed in the same style. This gave continuity to the submission. 

JBKS Architects were not successful in winning the job, but again this was not to do with the quality of the submission or the documentation we submitted. The church were very complimentary about the designs put forward, and were very impressed with the quality of the printed and presentation material. 

Clare has been able to use the document created as a template for other submission documents, and some of the aspects of the graphic design have been used in numerous other presentations and printed material. 

Clare thoroughly enjoyed the responsibility of preparing the submission for the competition, and enjoyed liaising between directors, architects and architectural assistants to make sure the right parts were being done at the right time. She enjoyed designing a printed brochure that captured the essence of the architectural design; something fun and friendly, but also professional and well executed. 


### Key Tasks:

- Leading a team of directors, architects and architectural assistants in producing the competition submission, including:
- Coordinating architectural design, presentation images and text
- Allocating work to colleagues based on experience and skills
- Answering questions and meeting deadlines
- Using Adobe InDesign to create the final submission booklet
- Preparing the interview presentation in the same style as the submission booklet
- Putting together a fee proposal for the work and agreeing this with a director
