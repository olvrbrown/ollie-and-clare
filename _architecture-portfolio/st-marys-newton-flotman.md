This small church in Newton Flotman, Norfolk want to create a new gallery in the nave, under which can be a new community room with access to a 'village shop vending machine' in the tower. Clare assisted in the job winning design and interview, and has recently taken on the role of project architect to complete the Concept Design drawings for consultation with Heritage England and the Victorian Society.

As the project is so far away, good communication is necessary between architect and client to make sure what JBKS Architects are proposing will fit and suit the existing building. Clare has been in close communication with the main client contact, which has been very helpful. 

### Key Tasks:

- Assisting in winning the job and attending the initial interview
- Project architect for Stage 1 - 3
- Developing the concept design drawings in close consultation with the client
- Project management and agreeing the project timeline to tender
