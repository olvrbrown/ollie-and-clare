Clare was responsible for compiling the submission document for this competition entry, and was able to attend the interview with a director. This included writing case studies, an overview of what the practice would do at each workstage, a detailed explanation of the feasibility study process and outcomes, and initial design ideas for the church.

Clare was very proud to have designed part of this competition scheme, coming up with the concept to put the worship space at first floor level and use the ground floor for the office and meeting room accommodation the church required. A scheme was drawn up and submitted as part of the initial competition entry. Clare also attended the subsequent interview.

The job was not won by JBKS Architects on the basis of fees, but Clare was pleased to have been a part of the design development and to have contributed design ideas to the scheme. She was again able to use her expertise and organisation in putting competition entries together to submit a proposal that was high quality and professional.
