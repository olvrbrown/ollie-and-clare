The final year of Clare’s undergraduate degree consisted of one larger design studio project located in Gloucester. This started off as a masterplanning project in groups, from which individual sites were chosen and designs were developed. The brief was left open, which was both a lot of fun and a challenge.

Clare designed a community hub on an existing car park site in-between Gloucester Cathedral and the Greyfriars site. The centre of the building was to be a debating chamber, to be used by local government and community groups. The building also contained a community café and shop, a hall, hireable meeting rooms and gallery space. The hub consisted of a number of buildings and spaces brought together by a common purpose, therefore was designed to be more like a street than a standalone building. This is clearly shown in the detailing of the different parts of the building. 

This was one of the first projects where detailed design was required. This was a learning curve, but very interesting and Clare enjoyed discussing her ideas with a structural engineer who came into the university to advise the students. Clare also built a large-scale model of the Community Hub, which was very useful in visualising and presenting spaces.
