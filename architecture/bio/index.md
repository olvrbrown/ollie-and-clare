Clare studied for her Part 1 at University of the West of England from 2006 to 2010. The four year BA degree in Architecture and Planning included a variety of design studio projects, as well as modules in history of architecture, structures, environmental design, history of planning, development control, and more. 

Clare started working for JBKS Architects as her Part I placement year in 2010, completing a year of full time work reducing her hours to two days a week throughout her Part 2 master’s degree. During the first year she worked on a number of projects at different stages, including job winning, concept design for Woodstock Road Baptist Church, writing design and access statements and submitting planning applications, and working alongside other members of staff to pull together tender drawings for St Peters Church, Furze Platt. 

Wanting to remain in Oxford and working part-time for JBKS Architects, Clare studied for her Part 2 qualification at Oxford Brookes University from 2011 – 2013. The Masters in Architectural Design consisted of a year of specialist study in Urban Design and a year-long design studio project set in Poplar, London. Clare greatly increased her design and communication skills during this time, as well as adding to her skills in Sketchup, V-Ray and InDesign.  

Returning to work full-time with JBKS Architects after her Masters, Clare was given the opportunity to get more involved in running her own projects. She decided to complete a full year of work before starting her Part 3, and during this time was able to get excellent experience of running a job on site, as well as winning jobs, appointments, planning applications and processes, and also became heavily involved in the marketing side of the practice. She is currently running six projects at different stages, varying from a £200,000 reordering of a Methodist Chapel to a £3.5 million extension to a town-centre church in Woking. 

Clare has excellent design and presentation skills, and very good experience in working with large, complex client bodies. She is well versed in the applications process for ecclesiastical and historic buildings and enjoys seeing old buildings repurposed for modern use. She has taken responsibility for redesigning office processes to make sure tasks are being completed efficiently, and likes being organised, meeting deadlines and completing her work to a very high standard.
